# TODO

## 0.2.0

- Scale chaos level back - right now, the potential for chaos grows exponentially with every component added to the tree. Not good.
- Write tests
- Add a way for components to opt out of chaos (maybe a noChaos prop?)

## Planned

- Add new types of chaos
  - Network chaos
  - Language chaos
  - Time chaos
  - Location chaos
- Support components that return functions
- Support nested components
- Performance improvements
- Support wrapping each immediate child once but specifying a different chaos level for each.
