## ‚ùì Why

- Because simple UI errors shouldn't bring down your app.
- This library can help expose areas of your component tree that don't handle errors very gracefully. Used in conjunction with [Error Boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html), this can be a powerful tool to improve the resiliency of your UI components.

## üõë Pre-Installation Notes

- This is currently WIP and a proof-of-concept.
- There is nothing in place to help ensure good performance practices. Use at your own risk.
- Nested components are not yet supported. Currently, only the immediate children wrapped with `withChaos` will have the potential for Chaos.
- Components that return functions / render props are not yet supported.

## üíª Installation

```
npm i --save-dev react-chaos
```

## üí• Usage

First, import the Chaos:

```
import withChaos from 'react-chaos';
```

Wrap any component with the Chaos:

```
const ComponentToWrap = () => <p>I may have chaos.</p>

const ComponentWithChaos = withChaos(ComponentToWrap);
```

You can optionally set a Chaos level between 1 and 10 (the higher the number, the more Chaos üòà) as well as a custom error message:

```
const ComponentWithChaos = withChaos(ComponentToWrap);

const ComponentWithChaos = withChaos(ComponentToWrap, 10, "This error message will almost certainly be shown since we are at Chaos level 10.");
```

Note: The default Chaos level is 5.

## üìù Other Notes

- Inspired by [Brandon Dail's post on React Error Boundaries and Fault Tolerance](https://aweary.dev/fault-tolerance-react/).
- Also inspired by watching Jurassic Park the night before writing this.

## TODO:

- Add tests [In Progress]
- Support chaos levels on a per-component basis [In Progress]
- Support custom chaos messages on a per-component basis [In Progress]
- Support wrapping wrapping each immediate child once but specifying a different chaos level for each. [In Progress]
- Support components that return functions
- Support nested components
- Performance improvements
- Ensure this can't run in production unless explicitly set to do so
