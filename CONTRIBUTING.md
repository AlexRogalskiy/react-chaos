## Contributing in react-chaos

We ❤️ contributions! The rules for contributing to this project are few:

1. Don't be a jerk
1. Search issues before opening a new one
1. Adhere to the code style the project has chosen

## Before Committing

1. Use at least Node.js v8 or higher. [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) can be handy for switching between Node versions.
1. Test your changes via `npm run test`. Only Pull Requests with passing tests will be accepted.

## Prerequisites

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 8 must be installed.

## Installation

- Running `npm install` in the component's root directory will install everything you need for development.

## Demo Development Server

- `npm start` inside the `demo` directory will run a development server with the projects's demo app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with hot module reloading.

## Running Tests

- `npm test` will run the tests once.

## Building

- `npm run build` will build the component for publishing to npm and also bundle the demo app.
